# Why Polygon?

If your not familiar with the Polygon Network we suggest you have a look over their [technology section](https://polygon.technology/technology/) for a more detailed insight.

As of late the Ethereum Network has shown it's issues when it comes to scalability. The immense rise in popularity of the blockchain over the past year has shown it cannot handle this many users without great expenses. Gas prices on Ethereum are at all time highs which greatly discourages people from interacting with the many decentralised applications that have been built on it, especially newcomers who are unfamiliar with how gas works. 

This is where Polygon offers a perfect solution to bypass these scalability issues. By building on top of the Ethereum Network as a layer-2 network, it acts as a "add-on" layer that can offload traffic. This is achieved by the computation needed for processing transactions being handled on the Polygon Network, then bundling these transactions into a block to be submitted on to the Ethereum blockchain. The benefits of doing this includes considerably quicker transactions times and lower costs. The average cost of interacting with a smart contract is so low it ranges in the one thousandths of a cent whereas on Ethereum it is costing users $10 minimum, and an average of $30.

This is why at PolyHeist we chose to build on Polygon. We did not want to punish our users by having to pay exorbitant gas prices to interact with our platform. Users will be able to play our games on PolyHeist with negligible gas prices that will not impact their earnings in even the slightest.
