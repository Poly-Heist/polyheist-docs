# ðŸš€ Deposits & Rewards

### Fees

With each deposit comes fees that will reduce your overall balance in the pot. These fees are subject to change \(within their maximum range\), but the current values will always be up to date on this page. The fees are as follows:

| Fee Type | Current Value \[%\] | Maximum Value \[%\] |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Distribution | 15 | 30 |
| Random Drop | 5 | 5 |
| Referral | 5 | 5 |
| Dev | 5 | 10 |

### Balance and Rewards

A users balance in the pot will be determined by taking away any applicable fees from their deposit amount. For example, Alice deposits 10 Matic and she has not been referred by a user. Her balance after fees will be:

This balance will determine your share of the pot rewards that come from the distribution fees. Take Aliceâ€™s balance of 7.5 Matic as an example, and letâ€™s say the combined total of all user balances is 50 Matic. Bob decides he wants in and makes a large deposit of 20 Matic. If we take the distribution fee from his deposit we get, reward pot = 20\*15/100 = 3 Matic. Therefore, Alice will receive a reward of:

Overtime, Alice will continue to earn rewards for every deposit, eventually earning back her initial deposit plus extra. Hence why this game is also a long-term investment!

### Minimum Deposit

The minimum amount a user can deposit changes overtime. The baseline minimum is 1 Matic but it must also meet a certain percentage of the current pot total. This percentage has a minimum of 0.0005% and a maximum of 0.001%. It will be displayed each time you deposit and decisions to raise it or lower it will be made based on the opinion of the community. At the minimum this does not come into play until the pot is over 20,000 Matic, therefore its impact will be seen in the later stages of the game. Employing this strategy means the pot will come to an end as the minimum deposit will grow larger and larger until no one is willing to outbid the last deposit.
