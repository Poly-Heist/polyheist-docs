# ðŸš¨ Heist

Heist is a long-term gamified investment, where the main goal is to be the last person to deposit into the pot. Each time a user deposits, a timer of 20 hours begins to countdown until another deposit is made to reset it. However, if that timer gets to zero, the last user to make the deposit wins the grand prize.  Donâ€™t worry though, until that time comes every user in the pot shares a percentage of each deposit made between them. Therefore, the little fish can get in early to earn rewards and as the pot grows the whales looking to win will start battling it out to win the grand prize.
