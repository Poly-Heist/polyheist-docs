# ðŸŽ² Random Drops

### Overview

Throughout the lifetime of the pot, random drops will take place in which users have a chance at winning the reward pot that comes from the random drop fees taken at deposit. Winners will be chosen at random using our provably fair random drop contract that uses [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf) to generate randomness using their oracles. 

### Requirements

To qualify for a drop the following criteria must be met:

* The user must have a minimum balance of 5 Matic
* The userâ€™s wallet must not be suspicious in anyway that leads us to believe its sole purpose is to gain entry to winning a drop
* Burner wallets with few transactions will not be rewarded
* Users can win multiple drops but cannot win back-to-back drops

We have made the choice to inspect each wallet to provide the best chance that a legitimate user will win a prize, we are looking to reward active members of the crypto community as well as our own. Note that winning a random drop will not affect your chances in winning the [final drop](the-final-drop.md)!
