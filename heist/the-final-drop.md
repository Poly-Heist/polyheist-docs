# üéÅ The Final Drop

### Overview

When the countdown has stopped and a winner has been verified, 20% of the winner‚Äôs pot will be allocated to the final drop. This drop works the same way as any other random drop, however the prize will be much larger and split between five different users. 

### Requirements

The same criteria must be met as outlined in the [random drop](random-drops.md) section with a single change. The users minimum balance to qualify is now 20 Matic. Don‚Äôt worry though this balance does not need to be met in one deposit, users have the full lifetime of the pot to reach this balance. Remember each deposit count's towards your balance, so you can meet this requirement whether that be through 20x1 Matic deposits or 2x10 Matic deposits etc.

### Rewards

For example, say the final balance of the winner‚Äôs pot is 100,000 Matic. The final drop balance will be:

In this example each of the five lucky winners will get a share of 4000 Matic just for having a balance of 20 Matic in the pot, not to mention the rewards they will have earned throughout.
