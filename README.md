### What is PolyHeist? ðŸ¤”

Welcome to PolyHeist, a gamified Dapp built on the [Polygon Network](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon) where everyone is a winner. To have the chance at taking home massive prizes in a range of cryptocurrencies, take part in one of our many games \(more to come soon\), all of which will be built on the blockchain where anyone can verify their legitimacy. We will be catering to all our users so that no matter their wallet size, they can join in the fun without blowing their budget. Please note, we highly recommended only indulging in these games with assets you can afford to lose entirely / be illiquid with \(depending on the game\). To kick start our launch check out our first ever game, conveniently named Heist which will use the native currency of the Polygon Network - $Matic. For more details take a look at the in-depth guide [here](heist/).
